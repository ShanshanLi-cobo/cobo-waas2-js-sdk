Developer fees are only relevant for platforms like payment service providers (PSPs) that charge fees to their downstream merchants.  The developer fee is added to the base amount (&#x60;order_amount&#x60;) to determine the final charge.

After expiration:  - The order status becomes final and cannot be changed - The &#x60;received_token_amount&#x60; field will no longer be updated - Funds received after expiration will be categorized as late payments and can only be settled from the developer balance. - A late payment will trigger a &#x60;transactionLate&#x60; webhook event.  | [optional] [default to 1800]

Example: If the cryptocurrency is USDT and &#x60;custom_exchange_rate&#x60; &#x3D; &#x60;\&quot;0.99\&quot;&#x60;, it means 1 USDT &#x3D; 0.99 USD.  | [optional]
