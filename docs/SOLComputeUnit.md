# CoboWaas2.SOLComputeUnit

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**compute_unit_price** | **String** | The cost per compute unit. Transactions consume computational resources measured in compute units, and this price helps determine the cost of executing transactions, especially complex ones involving smart contracts. | [optional] 
**compute_unit_limit** | **String** | The maximum number of compute units allowed for a transaction. This limits the resources any single transaction can consume, preventing excessive resource usage that could impact network performance negatively. | [optional]
