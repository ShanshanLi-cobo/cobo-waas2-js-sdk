# CoboWaas2.TransactionRequestUtxoFee

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**fee_rate** | **String** | The fee rate in sat/vByte. The fee rate represents the satoshis you are willing to pay for each byte of data that your transaction will consume on the blockchain. | [optional] 
**fallback** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the estimated fee is generated from Cobo’s fallback mechanism. When the estimated transaction belongs to a UTXO-based chain and the specified address does not have sufficient balance to cover the on-chain fee, this field will be set to &#x60;true&#x60;. In this case, the returned fee value is estimated by Cobo’s internal fallback strategy, which is typically higher than the actual on-chain fee. When &#x60;fallback&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;, please use the estimated fee value with caution. | [optional] 
**fee_type** | [**FeeType**](FeeType.md) |  | 
**token_id** | **String** | The token ID of the transaction fee. | 
**max_fee_amount** | **String** | The maximum fee that you are willing to pay for the transaction. Provide the value without applying precision. The transaction will fail if the transaction fee exceeds the maximum fee. | [optional]
